Made by Yi Zhou, Zicheng Wei, Yohanes Susanto, and Yaxuan Wang

### Contributions:

#### Project 1 written by Yi Zhou and Zicheng Wei:

Yi Zhou: a small part of EDA; the classification preprocessing part; the binary classification part

Zicheng Wei: multi class part; EDA on the Moodyâ€™s ratings and its analysis; preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, model fitting, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and ensembling for multiclass; conclusion

#### Project 2 written by Yohanes Susanto and Yaxuan Wang:

Yohanes Susanto: all the introduction and EDA; Linear Regression; the ensembling learning on Random Forest in-sample accuracy and importance features

Yaxuan Wang: fitted model on support vector machine, randome forest regression, and ridge regression; hyperparameter tuning on those models; conclusion
